# INCOIS 3D Ocean Data Visualization Platform

A web-based 3D ocean data visualization platform that combines INCOIS Bio-ROMS model fields, CMEMS ARMOR3D surface currents and QC-filtered Argo profiles over the Indian Ocean and India's EEZ, on a Cesium globe with a Three.js water-column view.

Developed for the **Smart India Hackathon 2026 (SIH 2026)**.

> **Frontend (static hosting):**  https://sih2026-drab.vercel.app
>
> Static hosting serves the same authentic artefacts (tiles, Argo profiles, precomputed
> comparisons). Point analytics, WMS and NetCDF export need the API: deploy
> `render.yaml` and build the frontend with `VITE_API_BASE_URL=<gateway URL>`.

## 2. Problem Statement

India's vast Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) and coastline demand continuous, high-resolution monitoring of ocean state variables. INCOIS routinely generates and archives large volumes of ocean model outputs (3D fields of temperature, salinity, currents, chlorophyll) as well as observational data from autonomous instruments such as Argo profiling floats and underwater Gliders.

### Key Gaps Identified:
1. **Lack of 3D Volumetric View:** Existing systems are largely restricted to 2D planar maps or desktop-bound software, failing to convey complex vertical water column phenomena (thermoclines, haloclines, and mixed layer depths).
2. **Disconnected Observation vs. Model Streams:** Operational oceanographers must toggle between separate software packages to compare model predictions with physical instrument soundings.
3. **Absence of Real-Time Depth Slicing:** Forecasters lack interactive tools to scrub through depth layers from the sea surface down to 2000m with dynamic colorbars and streamlines.
4. **Data Integrity & Synthetic Fallback Risks:** Standard web viewers often fill missing observations with unscientific synthetic interpolation rather than authentic source data.

---

## 3. Proposed Solution

- **Dual-engine view:** CesiumJS for geographic context (globe, fields, Argo markers, EEZ, currents) and Three.js for a water-column view at any ocean point.
- **Authentic data only:** every served value is traceable to a source NetCDF file through `frontend/public/api/catalog.json` (see [DATA_POLICY.md](DATA_POLICY.md)). Missing data is shown as "no data", never filled.
- **Model vs observation:** surface matchups between Argo floats and INCOIS Bio-ROMS with RMSE, MAE, bias and Pearson r computed from the listed pairs.
- **Open standards:** OGC WMS 1.3.0 and CF-1.8 NetCDF export from the same tiles.

## 4. Key Features (as implemented)

| Feature | Data | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Globe fields: SST, SSS, chlorophyll-a, MLD | INCOIS Bio-ROMS, 12 monthly timesteps of 2019, surface only | log scale for chlorophyll |
| Surface geostrophic currents | CMEMS ARMOR3D, 2024-12-31 only | arrows on the real 1° vector grid |
| Timeline | real catalog timesteps only | custom UTC range, step, speed, keyboard |
| Argo floats | 13 floats, latest QC 1/2 profile each | T, S, and O₂/Chl where measured |
| Profile analysis | observed MLD (ΔT = 0.2 °C) and thermocline | from the Argo profile |
| Model vs observation | Argo ≤10 m vs IBR surface, ±15 days | 2902120: 210 pairs; 2902084: 52 pairs |
| Point analytics | time series (OLS), spatial z-score, correlation | requires the API |
| Water-column view (Three.js) | real surface field + nearest Argo profile | no subsurface gridded data exists |
| WMS 1.3.0 / NetCDF export | catalogued tiles | exact subsets, real time/depth |
| Marine heatwaves (daily) + coral DHW | NOAA OISST v2.1, 1982–present | Hobday (2016) ≥5-day events, 1991–2020 baseline; CRW DHW |
| Marine heatwaves (monthly) + chlorophyll bloom | IBR 1980–2019 | 1990–2019 baseline and a detrended variant; HAB screening |
| Cyclone heat potential, GPI, eddy convergence | HYCOM 3-D temperature / currents, NCEP R1, OISST | indicators, not forecasts |
| Cyclone tracks + validation | IBTrACS v04r01 | layers checked at genesis points |
| Drift projection (spill / SAR) | HYCOM currents (3-hourly) + GFS wind | ensemble cone; assumptions labelled; skill vs GDP drifters |
| Advisory export | all hazard layers | GeoJSON and CAP 1.2 XML |

Depth slicing below the surface shows no gridded data by design: the available model and
analysis products are surface-only, and subsurface values are never interpolated or invented.

The C++ `ocean_core` (`cpp_visualizer/`) provides independent NetCDF readers, QC filtering
and a standalone tile exporter (`export_real_tiles`, labels tiles with source timestamps);
the served tiles come from the Python build script.

## 10. Screenshots / Prototype Previews

See [assets/screenshots/README.md](assets/screenshots/README.md) for full descriptions.

---

## 11. Installation

### Prerequisites
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) & Docker Compose (Recommended)
- *Or for manual setup:* Node.js 18+, Python 3.11+, and CMake / GCC (C++17)

### Step 1: Clone Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Akshit-Agrawal-769/SIH2026.git
cd SIH2026
```

### Step 2: Environment Configuration
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

---

## 12. Run

### Rebuilding the data (only when the source NetCDF files change)
```bash
pip install -r scripts/requirements-build.txt
python scripts/build_authentic_dataset.py --ibr-year 2019
```

### Disaster Early Warning products (external public datasets, no login)
```bash
python scripts/fetch_hf_datasets.py --with-ext-raw      # or: python scripts/download_external.py all
python scripts/build_ext_products.py all                 # -> datasets/ext_products + static copies
HF_TOKEN=... python scripts/upload_to_hf.py --ext-products --ext-raw
python scripts/nrt_update.py --upload                    # daily refresh (also .github/workflows/nrt-ingest.yml)
```
The data-service downloads `ext_products/*` from the Hugging Face dataset repo on first use and
re-checks it every `EXT_PRODUCTS_REFRESH_HOURS` (default 6). The daily GitHub Action needs the
repository secret `HF_TOKEN` to publish.

### Option 1: Docker
```bash
docker compose up --build -d
# optional: load the catalogued Argo profiles into PostGIS
docker exec -it incois_data_service python seed_data.py
```

### Option 2: Local Development
```bash
# Terminal 1: Python Data Service (reads frontend/public by default)
cd data-service
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload

# Terminal 2: Node Gateway
cd gateway
npm install
npm run dev

# Terminal 3: React Frontend
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev

# Tests
cd data-service && pytest tests/            # engine + API on the real catalog
cd frontend && npx vitest run               # timeline, colour scale, sound speed

# Optional C++ build
cmake -S cpp_visualizer -B cpp_visualizer/build && cmake --build cpp_visualizer/build
ctest --test-dir cpp_visualizer/build
```

## Important Security & Integrity Notice

- **Credentials:** no secrets are committed. `docker-compose.yml` only has local-development defaults for PostGIS/MinIO, bound to 127.0.0.1. The gateway has no built-in login; mutating endpoints stay disabled unless `JWT_SECRET` (gateway) and `ADMIN_API_TOKEN` (data-service) are set.
- **Scientific data policy:** see [DATA_POLICY.md](DATA_POLICY.md) and [METHODOLOGY.md](METHODOLOGY.md). The 2026-09 audit is summarised in [AUDIT_REPORT.md](AUDIT_REPORT.md).
